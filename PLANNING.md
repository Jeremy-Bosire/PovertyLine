# PovertyLine - Planning Document

## Project Vision
PovertyLine is a full-stack platform designed to bridge the gap between individuals living in poverty and available support services. It creates a two-way ecosystem where users can establish verified digital profiles while gaining access to resources, and stakeholders can analyze community-sourced poverty data for better intervention planning.

## Key Objectives
1. Create visibility for marginalized individuals through digital profiling
2. Match users with relevant resources based on their specific needs
3. Generate actionable insights on poverty patterns for stakeholders
4. Foster social inclusion by enabling story/experience sharing

## Architecture Overview

### System Architecture
- **Client-Server Architecture**: Clear separation between frontend and backend systems
- **API-First Design**: All functionality exposed through RESTful APIs
- **Microservices Approach**: Core components broken into distinct services
- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for mobile devices, with responsive desktop experience

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**:
  - Framework: React.js with Redux Toolkit
  - UI Library: Material-UI or Chakra UI
  - State Management: Redux Toolkit with React Query for data fetching
  - Forms: Formik with Yup validation
  - Visualization: D3.js or Chart.js for dashboard analytics
  
- **Backend**:
  - Framework: Flask (Python)
  - API Design: RESTful endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
  - Authentication: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
  - Database ORM: SQLAlchemy
  
- **Database**:
  - Primary Database: PostgreSQL
  - Schema Design: Normalized structure with appropriate indexes
  - Migration Tool: Alembic

- **DevOps**:
  - Containerization: Docker
  - Testing: Jest (Frontend), Pytest (Backend)
  - CI/CD: GitHub Actions
  - Hosting: Flexible deployment options (AWS, Digital Ocean, etc.)

### Security Considerations
- Data encryption at rest
- Secure authorization and authentication flow
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and request throttling
- Regular security audits

## Development Approach & Practices
- Agile development methodology
- Test-driven development where appropriate
- Regular code reviews
- Feature branching workflow
- Continuous integration and deployment
- Documentation as code

## MVP Scope
The Minimum Viable Product will focus on:
1. Core user authentication and profile creation
2. Basic resource board functionality
3. Simple admin dashboard with essential metrics
4. Search and filter capability for resources
5. Mobile-responsive design

Future phases will expand to include the storytelling system, advanced analytics, and integration with additional services.

## Project Constraints
- Mobile-first approach due to target users' primary access method
- Potential offline functionality for areas with limited connectivity
- Emphasis on data privacy and security
- Localization considerations for multiple languages
- Low-bandwidth optimizations

## Success Metrics
- Number of active user profiles
- Resource match rate
- User-to-resource conversion rate
- Stakeholder engagement metrics
- Platform usage analytics
